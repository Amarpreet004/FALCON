## 🔧 Option 1: Gmail Setup (Recommended - 2 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Click "Security" 
3. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled

### Step 2: Create App Password
1. In Google Account Security settings
2. Click "App passwords"
3. Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
4. Enter "Website Contact Form"
5. Copy the generated 16-character password

### Step 3: Update Environment Variable
1. Open `.env.local` file
2. Replace `your_gmail_app_password_here` with your actual app password:
```bash
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

### Step 4: Restart Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### When someone submits the form:
1. **Form Validation**: All required fields checked
2. **Data Sent**: Form data sent to `/api/contact` endpoint
3. **Email Generated**: Server creates formatted email
4. **Email Sent**: Sent to `falconsolutions492@gmail.com` via Gmail SMTP
5. **Confirmation**: User sees success message

### Email Format You'll Receive:
```
Subject: New Contact Form Submission from [Customer Name]
